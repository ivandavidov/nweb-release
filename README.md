# nWeb as BOSH release

This is [BOSH release](https://bosh.io/docs/release.html) for the [nWeb](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/systems/library/es-nweb/index.html) web server.

The release contains one package and one job (and no blobs). As result the deployment manifest is very simple and easy to understand. This repository is used as submodule in the [learn-bosh2](https://github.com/ivandavidov/learn-bosh2) project.
